The scraper still need work to get to scrape go over other pages.

Notes:
 - I dealt with signing in with a simple GUI. The app includes a node.js express.js server.
 - Scraping is done with selenium library and its chrome driver.
 - I am editing user agent to that of chrome on windows to hide the user agent of selenium.
 - I am randomizing the time of click for any software not to detect bot movement.
 - still a user needs to do captchaa and security checks when needed


Steps:
 - clone repo
 - have node and npm on your machine
 - npm install
 - node server.js to run the server
 - open localhost:888
 -
